This concept and accompanying calculations were developed in collaboration with advanced AI tools for research and conceptual purposes.
While I do not hold formal academic credentials in aerospace engineering or quantum physics, my goal is to share bold, open-source ideas that can inspire innovation and collaboration for humanity’s future among the stars.
“BlinkDrive” is a conceptual name for this open-source propulsion project. If any future trademark conflicts arise, the project may be renamed (e.g., Equinox Propulsion) without changing its open-source status under CC0 license.
